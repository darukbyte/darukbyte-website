            <h2>How I made this web?</h2>
            <p>
              I meticulously craft the logo, branding, and design design
              harnessing my UX and UI expertise. My development skills bring
              these concepts to life in the cool and unique web. I employ Figma
              to create the logo and assets needed for my web, Midjourney for
              the portrait illustration, ChatGPT for refining text, and pure
              HTML/CSS to animate the SVGs that you see in this web. The
              development is executed using React, Next.js, and uses GSAP
              ensuring seamless animations and microinteractions. If you&apos;re
              interested in a website like this one, don&apos;t hesitate to{" "}
              <a href="#">email me</a>, and together, we can push the boundaries
              of creativity to new horizons.
